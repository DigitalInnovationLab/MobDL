# MobDL

This library is used to deploy Mask RCNN in mobile device and help in monitoring the performance of the model.

You can download the sample dataset of Nuclie images from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018) or use already trained model from [GDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wc7ZEWvAEvhFin8yr2TL_tdRCnuh4-0y/view?usp=sharing) to start prediction in mobile device.

## How to use

 - Add your trained model inside the maskrcnn_python_app/app/src/main/python 
 - Update maskrcnn_python_app/app/src/main/python/prediction/parasite/test.py with your model's configuration
 - Deploy and test the model
